         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For God will ſave <hi>Sion,</hi> the Salvation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> comes out of <hi>Sion</hi> (to wit) Chriſt, who is elect and precious, laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> but not in the outward Hill, or <hi>Mount-Sion;</hi> for Chriſt was born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, by Prophecy concerning Chriſt, <hi>O that the Salvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>was come out of</hi> Sion; <hi>when the Lord brings back the Captivity of his People,</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall rejoyce, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be glad,</hi> Pſal. 14. And again he ſaith, <hi>Let</hi> Iſrael <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord that made him, let the Children of</hi> Sion <hi>be joyful in their King; for</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall be redeemed through Judgment, and her Converts through Righteouſneſs.</hi> Is not this <hi>Sion</hi> Gods People, and not the outward Hill? <hi>For out of</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall go forth a Law, and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem: Is not this <hi>heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>heavenly Sion,</hi> that the Word of the Lord and his Law goes out of, and not out of the outward Hill <hi>Sion? In the laſt dayes (Iſaiah</hi> ſaith) <hi>that the Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed on the top of all Mountains, and exalted above all the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it:</hi> Is not this <hi>heavenly Mount-Sion,</hi> and <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem?</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high, he hath filled</hi> Sion <hi>with Judgment and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Sion</hi> is called a <hi>City of our Solemnity, and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down; not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the Cords thereof be broken;</hi> Is not this <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>heavenly Sion?</hi> But let the Hypocrites or Sinners of outward <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:207491:3"/>be afraid, which may be removed or broken, which <hi>heavenly Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> cannot; for no unclean thing enters into it. <hi>O</hi> Sion! <hi>that bringeſt good Tidings, get thee up into the high Mountain of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that brings good tidings; lift up thy Voice with ſtrength, lift it up, be not afraid; Say unto the City of</hi> Judah, <hi>Behold your God.</hi> So here's <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that bring good tidings.</p>
               <p>Now, do ye think that this was the outward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hill? for Chriſt was born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> a Cheif Corner Stone, elect and precious, laid in <hi>Sion;</hi> but it doth not ſay in the <hi>outward Hili Sion.</hi> Iſaiah ſpeakes by prophecy, Iſa. 51. <hi>He will comfort all her waſte places, and he will make her Wilderneſs like</hi> Eden, <hi>and her Deſart like the Garden of the Lord; Joy and Gladneſs ſhall be found therein, Thanks-giving and the Voice of Melody: I have put my Words in thy Mouth, and have Covered thee, even in the Shadow of my hand, that I may plant the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth, and ſay unto</hi> Sion, <hi>Thou art my People.</hi> Here you may ſee, that <hi>Sion</hi> is Gods People; And how beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of him that brings glad Tidings, that publiſhes Peace, that brings good Tidings of good, that publiſheth Salvation, that ſaith unto <hi>Sion, Thy God riegns,</hi> when the Lord ſhall bring again <hi>Sion,</hi> (to wit) his People; for the outward Mountain, with the outward Hill, was not removed; and the Redeemer ſhall come to <hi>Sion,</hi> and unto them that are turned from Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And this Redeemer is Chriſt. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith <hi>Who hath ſeen ſuch a thing, and who hath heard ſuch things? Shall a Nation be born at once?</hi> For ſo ſoon as <hi>Sion</hi> travelled ſhe brought forth her Chileren.</p>
               <p>Now here you may ſee the wonder of <hi>Sion's</hi> Travel, which was not the Great Hill, nor Watch-Tower in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhall yet Comfort Sion,</hi> (that is) <hi>his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Zach. 1. And <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhout thou Daughter of</hi> Sion. And again he ſaith to <hi>Sion, Let not thy hand be ſlack:</hi> ſo <hi>Sion</hi> was and is Gods People. And <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the Laſt dayes, &amp;c. the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed above all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and it ſhall be exalted, above all the Hills:</hi> So here is Gods heavenly Mountain or Watch Tower, which is above, all Hills and Mountains, <hi>and People ſhall flow unto it, and many Nations ſhall come, and ſay, Come let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, and to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his Paths.</hi> Here God is the Teacher of his People, and Nations; for theſe laſt

The <hi>Jews</hi> in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had the Law given to them at the outward Hill <hi>Moum-Sion,</hi> who had the outward Hill North in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called, <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> and read the outward Law in outward <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but the Mountain of the Lord, or <hi>heavenly Mount-Sion,</hi> which is called the Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord, is eſtabliſhed on the top of all the Mountains, and exalted above all the Hills, ſo that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may ſee it, and ſlow unto it.

               <p>THe Apoſtle bids the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Put on the whole</hi> Armour <hi>of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; for we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:207491:4"/>Spiritual Wickedneſs in High-places.</hi> So this Wreſtling was with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Weapons, Spiritual Men; for Carnal Men Wreſtle with Fleſh and Blood, and with Carnal Weapons, and mens <hi>Armour,</hi> and not the <hi>Armour</hi> of God. And again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Take unto you the whole</hi> Armour <hi>of God, that you may be able to ſtand in the Evil day; having done, and having overcome all, to ſtand, having your Loyns girt with Truth.</hi> So this is a heavenly Girdle, not natural; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, this is a Spiritual Breaſt-plate, not Natural, having your Feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, which is the Power of God, over the Devil, and before he was; to be ſhod thus, is not with outward ſhoes, but with that which will never wax old nor wear out; and above all, take the ſhield of Faith, that Faith which Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked; this Shield of Faith is Holy, Divine and Precious, and is the Victory; which Spiritual Faith, God and Chriſt is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of, and not Men: And <hi>take unto you the Holmet of Salvation and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</hi> Phil. 6. This Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of Salvation is Spiritual, and the Sword is Spiritual; ſo not a natural Sword, or a natural Helmet; and the Word of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Hammer,</hi> a <hi>Fire,</hi> and a <hi>Sword,</hi> to hammer down, and cut down, and burn up that which hath made a Separation betwixt man and God; and it is called the <hi>Word of Reconciliation, that reconciles to God.</hi> So the true Church and Miniſters of Chriſt are to prove themſelves <hi>by Pureneſs, by Knowledge, by Long-ſuffering, by Kindneſs, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, by Love unfeigned, by the Word of Truth, by the Power of God, by the</hi> Armour <hi>of Righteouſneſs, on the Right hand and on the Left,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. For though the Church of Chriſt do walk in the Fleſh, yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We do not</hi> War <hi>after the Fleſh; for the</hi> Weapons <hi>of our</hi> Warfare <hi>are not Carnal, but Mighty through God, to the plucking down of ſtrong-Holds</hi> (to wit, of <hi>Satan) caſting down Imaginations, and every High thing that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought, to the Obedience of Chirſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in readineſs to revenge all Diſobedience.</hi> This is with Spiritual Weapons, not Carnal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Romans, The night is far ſpent, and the day is at hand, let us caſt off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Works of Darkneſs, and put on the</hi> Armour <hi>of</hi> Light: This <hi>Armour</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> is not Natural, but Divine and Spiritual, to all the Children of the Light, and of the day; this <hi>Armour</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> is afore Darkneſs was and the Devil the Power of it, and he the Power of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207491:5"/>Darkneſs cannot pearce thorow this Armour of Light; and this <hi>Armour</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> is above all natural and carnal <hi>Armour;</hi> and all the Children of the Light, that walk in this <hi>Light,</hi> and this <hi>Armour,</hi> they walk honeſtly, and decently, as in the day; for they that walk in <hi>Rioting, Drunhenneſs, Chambering and Wantonneſs, make proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfill the Luſts thereof;</hi> ſuch are naked concerning this <hi>Armour</hi> of Light, and though they may make profeſſion of Chriſt, they do not put him on as in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keeps his Houſe, his Goods are at peace, but when a ſtronger then he ſhall come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his</hi> Armour <hi>wherein he truſted, and ſpoils his Goods, &amp;c.</hi> Is not Chriſt ſtronger than the Devil that hath kept the Houſe of the hearts of People? And doth not he diſarm him and ſpoil his Goods? And is not Chriſts Weapon Spiritual? And the Lord ſaith to <hi>Zachariah, Not by might nor by power</hi> (to wit of men) <hi>but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> Zach. 4. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Comfort ye my People, ſpake ye comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and Cry unto her that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her Iniquity is pardoned, &amp;c.</hi> Is not this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Gods People, whoſe Iniquity Chriſt pardons, and warfare is accompliſhed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. And again <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. and <hi>Micah</hi> 4. (ſpaking of Chriſt) <hi>He ſhall judge amongſt the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many People, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn</hi> War <hi>any more, but they ſhall ſit every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-Tree, and none ſhall make them affraid, for the Mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpaken it:</hi> Is not this Vine Chriſt? And are not theſe the days of his Goſpel of Peace?</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Come, behold the Works of the Lord, what deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he makes in the Earth, he makes Wars to ceaſe unto the ends of the Earth, he breaks the Bow and cuts the Spear in ſunder, he burns the Chariots in fire,</hi> Pſal. 46. <hi>The Lord rebukes the company of Spear-men, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Bulls, with the Calves of the People, till every one ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> (to wit) to the Lord who ſcatters the People that delight in <hi>War:</hi> And are not theſe the days of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, <hi>who aſcended on high and led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men that the Lord God might dwell amongſt them,</hi> Pſal. 68. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. where the Apoſtles ſhews the fulfilling of it; and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, in his general Epiſtle to the Church of Chriſt, <hi>From whence comes</hi> Wars <hi>and Fightings amongſt you? Come they not even of your Luſts,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:207491:5"/>that</hi> war <hi>in your Members,</hi> (Mark, in your Members) <hi>James</hi> 4. So here is a <hi>War</hi> in your Members, the ground of it is from your Luſts, before the <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> were outwardly amongſt People, which <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi> without, comes from the Luſts of the Members within. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the 11th chapter, <hi>who by Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, ſtopt the Mouthes of Lyons, quencht the Violence of Fire, eſcaped the edge of the Sword;</hi> this was the <hi>Sheild of Faith,</hi> a ſtronger weapon than outward Swords, and is a ſtronger Weapon than Fire, and can quench the Violence of it, that ſtopt the Mouthes of Lyons; this is beyond Carnal Weapons, which <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> may overcome. And the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. <hi>Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, and endure hardſhip, as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>Timothy</hi> did not <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> with Carnal Weapons, as he was as a ſouldier of Chriſt, but with Chriſts heavenly <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Armour;</hi> for as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, in his general Epiſtle to the Church, <hi>For as much then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the Fleſh,</hi> arm <hi>your ſelves likewiſe with the ſame mind,</hi> (to wit, of Chriſt) <hi>for he that hath ſuffered in the Fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin that he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the Fleſh to the Luſts of men, but to the Will of God: for the time paſt of our Life, may ſuffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles or Nations.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Yeild not your Members as Inſtruments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs unto Sin, but yield your Members unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your Members as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto God.</hi> So its clear, they that yeild their Members as Inſtruments of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto ſin, are not alive unto God; and the two Witneſſes that had power to ſmite the Earth as often as they would, do you think that they did it with carnal Weapons? <hi>And there was</hi> War <hi>in Heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels fought againſt the</hi> Dragon, <hi>and the</hi> Dragon <hi>fought againſt his Angels, and the</hi> Dragon <hi>prevailed not, neither was there any more place found in Heaven for him, but he and his Angels, were caſt out into the Earth,</hi> Rev. 12. Now the holy Angels of God are Spirits, ſo then they had Spiritual Weapons, and not carral Swords, Muskets, Pikes, and Piſtols, &amp;c. to ſight with the <hi>Dragon.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <q>I ſaw Heaven open, and behold, a white Horſe, and he that ſate upon him, was called Faithful and true, and in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs he doth Judge, and make <hi>War,</hi> &amp;c. and he was clothed with a Veſture dipt in Blood, and his Name was called, <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and the Armies which were in Heaven followed him, upon White

And the Beaſt, and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies gathered together to make <hi>War</hi> againſt him that ſate on the Horſe, and his Army, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; but the Beaſt was taken, and the falſe Prophet, &amp;c. and them that had received the Mark of the Beaſt, and had worſhipped his Image, theſe both were caſt alive into the Lake of fire, burning with brimſtone, and the Remnant were ſlain with the Sword of him that ſate upon the White Horſe, which Sword proceeded out of his Mouth, <bibl>
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.</bibl>
                  </q> And were theſe, think you, carnal Weapons, that Chriſt and his Followers made <hi>War</hi> with, againſt the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, and they that worſhipped the Beaſt and his Image, and received his Mark, and took them, and overcame them, and caſt the Beaſt and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the Lake that burns with Brimſtone? And was that an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carnal Sword that went out of his Mouth, by which he ſlew the Beaſts worſhippers, that had his Marks, and Image? Do you think that Chriſt or his Army, that ſate on White Horſes, and followed him, which were in Heaven, that they had outward <hi>Swords, and Piſtels, and Pikes, and Muskets, and Guns, and Cannons,</hi> by which they overcome the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet? No; it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſts Army was cloathed with fine Linnen;</hi> and Chriſts Veſture was dipt in Blood, which Army followed him in Heaven. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> lift up his Eyes to Heaven and bleſt the moſt High, and ſaid, all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing, and the Lord doth according to his will, in the Armies of Heaven, and amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Earth, and none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay unto him, What doſt thou? Here you may ſee <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> was made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the great God who ſaw his Armies in Heaven, who abaſed his Pride. And Jeſus ſaid unto <hi>Pilate, My Kingdom is not of this World, if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my Kingdom not from hence</hi> (that is, of this World) <hi>John</hi> 18.36.

And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Of a Truth, I perceive that God is no Reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation, he that fears God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him.</hi> So here you may ſee, it is not he that talketh of Righteouſneſs out of the fear of God, and worketh not Righteouſneſs, is accepted with the Righteous God, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every one that doth evil hates the Light, neither comes to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here you may ſee, who are them that hate the Light of Chriſt, who is the Life in him, who enlightens every man that comes into the World, every one that doth evil hates the ſaving heavenly Light of Chriſt, which they ſhould believe in, and become Children of the Light; and they that do evil and hate the Light, neither come to the Light, leſt their Deeds ſhould be reproved; all theſe Doers of Evil, and Haters of the Light of Chriſt, and will not come to it, leſt their evil deeds ſhould be reproved, all ſuch God nor Chriſt doth not accept their Offerings nor Sacrifices; and ſuch that hate the Light of Chriſt, hate Chriſt, though they may preach him, and profeſs him in words; yet they perſecute, and hate the Believers in the Light of Chriſt, which are the Children of the Light, and walk in the Light, and are the Children of the day of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And again, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that doth Truth comes to the Light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> So it is not he that only talks of Truth, but <hi>[Mark]</hi> he that doth Truth, comes to the heavenly and ſpiritual Light of Chriſt, that with his ſpiritual Light he may ſee his deeds, that they are wrought in God; this is a bleſſed work, and a bleſſed ſight to ſee, and a happy comfort, and a ſatisfaction to every one, and ſuch God doth accept, and reſpect their Offering; and all the Children of the Lord are to be tender one to another; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If I then, your Lord and Maſter, have waſht your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet; for I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done unto you,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 13. And this is a Practice of Humility, in condeſcending, in the tender Light of Chriſt, one to another.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> in his general Epiſtle, ſaith, <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive you, he that doth Righteouſneſs, is Righteous, even as he is Righteous; whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of God, &amp;c.</hi> So here you may ſee, it is not the Puft-up Boaſters and Talkers of Righteouſneſs, but them that do it, are of God. And was it not the Reaſon that <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Brother, becauſe his works were Evil, and <hi>Abel</hi>'s were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:207491:8"/>Righteous? And is it not the cauſe now of Priſoning and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, both with Tongue and Hand, becauſe their Works are Evil, and of them that did and doth perſecute the Righteous now, but let them not be weary in well-doing; for in due ſeaſon they ſhall reap, if they faint not; <hi>for they that do evil, ſow to the fleſh, and ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that is in the Spirit of God, ſows to the Spirit, and ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Eternal;</hi> And whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free; for there is no reſpect of Perſons with God, for he doth accept all that are the Servants of Chriſt, and do the Will of God from their Hearts; but he that doth wrong, receives for the wrong which he hath done; for God is no reſpecter of Perſons, for he doth render to every man according to his deeds; but them who by patience continue in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, eternal Life, but unto them that are Contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, Indignation, Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of man that doth Evil, of the <hi>Jew</hi> firſt, and alſo of the <hi>Gentile;</hi> but Glory, Honour and Peace to every man that worketh good, to the <hi>Jew</hi> firſt, and alſo to the <hi>Gentile;</hi> for there is no reſpect of Perſons with God. And as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, and a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit.</hi> So by their fruits Trees are known; <hi>for it is not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> So here you may ſee, that it is not only the Talkers of God and Chriſt, that enter into the Kingdom of God, but every one that hears the Sayings of Chriſt, and doth them, is likened to a Wiſe man, which built his Houſe upon a Rock, that neither the Rain, Floods nor Wind ſhall beat it down, becauſe it is founded upon a Rock; but every one that hears the ſayings of Chriſt, and doth them not, is likned to a fooliſh man which built his Houſe upon the Sand, and the Rain, and the Floods, and the Winds beat upon his Houſe, and it falls, and great is the fall of it. Theſe are them that do not the Will of God, theſe are the Sayers, and not Doers, theſe are them that walk not in the Light, nor Grace, nor Truth, nor Spirit, nor Goſpel of Chriſt; theſe are the Hearers of the Word, but not Doers of the Word, which deceive their own ſelves, and are likned to a man that beholds his natural face in a Glaſs, and ſtreight way forgets what manner of man he was; but that man which is the doer of the Work, and the Word of God, is bleſſed in his deed;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:207491:9"/>to him that knows to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin: And Chriſt ſaid, The Jews, Scribes and Phariſees, they ſay, and do not (that is) they ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets words, but they did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets words; and now the Chriſtians they have Chriſts and the Apoſtles words, and ſay them often over, but the ſame Wo will be to them (that was againſt the Phariſees) that do them not: And Chriſt ſaith, But all their works they do, for to be ſeen of men; but ſuch Works and Doers are not accepted with God and Chriſt; for he cryes, Wo againſt ſuch Workers; and Chriſt commanded them that improved their Talents, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servants, that he had been faithful in a few things, he would make them Ruler over many things;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Enter into the Joy of the Lord</hi> So the Wicked go into Everlaſting Puniſhment and the Righteous into Life Eternal. And therefore the Saints are to take unto them the whole Armour of God, that they may be able to ſtand in the evil Day, and having done all, to ſtand in his Armour; for every ſin that a man doth, is without his Body, and every one ſhall receive according to the things done in his Body. So here you may ſee, he muſt have Truth's judgment and ſentence upon the ſins done out of the body, &amp; upon the ſins done in the Body, by Thoughts and Imaginations, before they be acted outwardly. So every one ſhall receive a Reward and Judgment according to his Works, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they be good or evil; and therefore all the Saints have need of Patience to exerciſe that Gift, that after they have done the will of God, they might inherit his Promiſe of eternal Life; for ſo is the Will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men. So it is not only well talking, but well doing; for it is ſaid, That God hears not Sinners; for they that go into ſin, and do evil, go out of Gods ſpirit of Grace and ſavour; but if any man be a Worſhipper of God in his ſpirit and truth, and doth his Will, him he heareth in his Spirit; and therefore are all Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren exhorted to walk in the Faith, and by the Faith, which Chriſt is the Author of, to walk in the Light of Chriſt, in which they have fellowſhip one with another; and to walk in the Spirit of God, by which they are circumciſed and baptized, in which they have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk in him. So it is not only Talkers of the Light, and Spirit, and Faith, and of the Will of God and Chriſt, and his Will and his Doctrine, but them that walk in his Will and do his Will, &amp;c. that are accepted, and enter into his Kingdom that he hath prepared for them.</p>

               <p>GOD ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life; <hi>for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dyed, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> And Chriſt by the Grace of God hath taſted Death for every man, and is a Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, the one Mediator betwixt God and Man, through Death deſtroys Death, and the Devil, the power of Death; for ſin brought Death, and the Devil, who abode not in the Truth, in whom there is no Truth, he is the Power of Death; and Chriſt, who is the Truth and the Life, makes an end of ſin, that brought Death, and deſtroys Death and the Devil, the Power of Death; for the Son of God was manifeſt that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſin, and to make a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs into Man and Woman. Here is the work of the Son of God, who bruiſes the Serpents Head, breaks his Power, and deſtroys the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, he is the Saviour, called the ſeed of the VVoman, in which Seed, Chriſt, all Nations are bleſſed, which bruiſes the Serpents head, which hath brought man into the Curſe and Sin, Darkneſs and Corruption, &amp;c. but in this ſeed, Chriſt, that bruiſes the ſerpents head, &amp; deſtroys his works, are all Nations bleſt, &amp; all in aniformity, unity and fellowſhip one with another, and with the Son and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore all muſt come into this eed, Chriſt Jeſus, if they come into the beavenly unity and uniformity, and that ye may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowship of the ſuffering of Chriſt, being made conformable unto his death, who by the Grace of God taſted Death for every man; for in <hi>Adam</hi> all dyed. Now Chriſt by the grace of God having taſted death for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:207491:10"/>every man, that every man may be conformable unto his death: Here is a conformity unto the Death of Chriſt; for ye muſt all dye with him before ye live with him, and ye muſt all ſuffer with him, if ye reign with him; and therefore all Men and Women in the whole world, of what Religion or Opinion ſoever ye be of, in old <hi>Adam</hi> ye all dyed, and are dead, and Chriſt by the grace of God hath taſted Death for you all, and by Chriſt ye are all made alive; and therefore ye muſt all be made conformable to Chriſts death, and that is the Conformity ye are all to preſs after, and to exhort one another to be conformable to the death of Chriſt, and to dye with him, if ye do intend to live with him, and to ſuffer with him, and to come into the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, if ye reign with Chriſt, or do intend to reign with him, yea, all that do profeſs Chriſt the Son of God, they ought to be conformed to the Image of the Son of God; and if that ye be not conformed to the Image of God, who deſtroys the Devil and his Works, your outward profeſſion will ſtand ye in no more ſtead than the <hi>Jews</hi> Profeſſion without Life, but all that are conformable to the Image of the Son of God, in his Image they are in uniformity, and in unity, Hallelujah, praiſing the Lord.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Saints, <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of the Mind, &amp;c. to the Image of the Son of God, and being made conformable unto his Death,</hi> Phil. 3.10. Rom. 8.29. &amp; 12. &amp; 2. And now, all People, if ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the death of Chriſt, that hath taſted Death for you all, then you are yet alive in your ſin; and if ye be not conformed to the Image of the Son of God, who bruiſes the ſerpents head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Devil and his Works, what Image then are ye conformable to? all your Profeſſion, without ye be conformed to the Image of the Son of God, is nothing; which who do ſo conform, are in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly unity and conformity, and Chriſt, who taſted Death for every man (for all dyed in <hi>Adam</hi>) he enlightens every man that comes into the world, with his heavenly Light, which is the Life in him, the Word by whom all things were made. Now every man and woman being turned to the Light, which is the Life in Chriſt, and believing in it, and walking in it, is the means by which they may be made conformable to the Image of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and ſo come into Unity, and Conformity, and Fellowſhip one with another, and with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>And the Grace of God which brings ſalvation, hath appeared unto

Now if all People will be conformed to the Image of the Son of God, it muſt be through this grace that comes from the Son of God; and this grace is in their hearts, to ſettle them, and ſtabliſh them, which teaches them to deny that which is ungodly and unrighteous, and to receive and cleave to that which is godly and righteous.</p>
               <p>And ſo, here is Gods Love and favour to all men, who dyed in <hi>Adam,</hi> that his grace and favour ſhould appear unto all men, to teach them and bring their Salvation, that they may be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſts death, who hath taſted death for them all, and dye and live with him, and ſuffer and reign with him, and ſo be conformable to the Image of the ſon of God; and here is a heavenly divine and ſpiritual Conformity and Uniformity.</p>

And the Apoſtle exhorted the Marriners that were in the Ship, <q>To be of good cheer, for there ſhall be no loſs of any mans Life; I believe in God, and that it ſhall be even as it was told me (to wit) by the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. And the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Give attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the Gift that is in thee; and bad <hi>Timothy,</hi> Teach and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and to be an Example to the Believers in Word, Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith, Charity and Purity, <bibl>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6.</bibl>
                  </q> And the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <q>Preach the Word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine; the time will come when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, but turn their Ears away from the Truth, and heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears.</q> And therefore ye ſee the Churches authority, to Exhort, Rebuke and Reprove ſuch, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. But the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <q>Rebuke not an Elder, but entreat him as a Father, and the elder Women as Mothers, &amp;c. <bibl>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</bibl>
                  </q> And the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Titus,</hi> in Chap. 2. <q>Exhort, rebuke with all Authority, and exhort Servants to be obedient to their own Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may adorn the Doctrine of God in all things.</q> And the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>Titus,</hi> 
                  <q>To ſet in order the things that are wanting in <hi>Creet,</hi> and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee:</q> And they were to be ſuch as were able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince Gain-ſayers; and the Apoſtle exhorted <hi>Titus, To rebuke ſharply the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nruly, and vain Talkers and Deceivers,</hi> Tit. 1. And <hi>Titus</hi> received the Apoſtles Exhortation, when they ſent him to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>A man that is a Heretick after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, reject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <q>Let us conſider one another, to provoke one another unto good Works, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the Day approach (to wit) of Chriſt Jeſus, <bibl>
                        <hi>Heb</hi> 10 24, 25.</bibl>
                  </q> And the Apoſtle ſaid, <q>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſeech you Brethren, ſuffer ye the Word of Exhortation, &amp;c. <bibl>
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</bibl>
                  </q> And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> 
                  <q>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all Wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another, &amp;c. <bibl>
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</bibl>
                  </q> So here you may ſee the Church of Chriſt, from his Word dwelling in them, were able to teach and admoniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Word of Wiſdom in them. So it ſeems then they did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:207491:13"/>not ſet a Prieſt over, them that he might be always teaching of them, and they might be always paying of them. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>I my ſelf alſo am perſwaded of you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that ye are full of Goodneſs, and filled with all Knowledge, able alſo to Admoniſh one another.</hi> So here you may ſee the Church of the <hi>Romans</hi> were able to admoniſh one another then, without ſetting up of Colledges to make Prieſts to admoniſh them; and therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in Chap. 2. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a Crocked Generation, among whom ye ſhine as Lights in the World, holding forth the Word of Life:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I have ſent</hi> Tythicus <hi>unto you, the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>that he might know your Affairs, and he might Comfort your Hearts,</hi> Epheſ. 6. Here the Churches knew, and made known the Affairs one of another in the Lord. And <hi>Jude</hi> exhorted the Church in his general Epiſtle, <hi>That they ſhould earneſtly contend for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints or ſanctified Ones, which Faith Chriſt is the author and finiſher of.</hi> And now, had all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> contended for this Faith or Belief, then they would not have made ſo many Faiths or Beliefs to kill and deſtroy one another about, which had they kept in Chriſts ſaving Faith, which ſaves and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, and with that Shield of Faith ye do not War with Fleſh and Blood to deſtroy it. And the Lord ſent <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to admoniſh the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould not go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the Word of the Lord unto <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and went into <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore <hi>Jeremiah</hi> told them, <hi>They ſhould dye in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and ſhould be conſumed,</hi> Jer. 42.43, 44. Here you may ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of them that diſobeyed the admoniſhment of the Lord and his Prophet; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Better is a poor and a wiſe Child, then an old and ſooliſh King, who will no more be admoniſhed, or knoweth not to be admoniſhed,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The words of the Wiſe are as Goards and as Nails faſtened by the Maſters of Aſſemblies.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by theſe my Son be admoniſhed,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. So it is good for all to receive the Exhortations and Admoniſhments from the Power and Spirit of Chriſt; and Chriſt bad <hi>John</hi> write unto the Church of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira,</hi> and <hi>that he had a few things againſt them, becauſe they ſuffered</hi> Jezabel <hi>to teach,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 2. And ſo you may ſee this Church came under Reproof, becauſe they did not make uſe of their Power and Authority, in the Spirit of Chriſt to judge <hi>Jezabel's</hi> Spirit; and therefore the Church of Chriſt now is not to ſuffer <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s Spirit leſt they come under the ſame Reproof, if they ſuffer that <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:207491:14"/>Spirit to teach, now as then. And here you may ſee how that Chriſt hath given his Church Power and Authority in his holy Spirit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, exhort, judge, reprove and rebuke in his Power and Spirit.</p>

               <head>Concorning ſuch as cry againſt Orders.</head>
               <p>GOD is a God of Order, and not of Conſuſion; and the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in Order.</hi> [Mark, all things in the Church of Chriſt.] So then there is nothing to be done undecently, out of the Order of the peaceable Truth; for God is not the author of Confuſion, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, or Unquietneſs, but of Peace in all the Churches of the Saints; and therefore if God be not the Author of ſuch Confuſion, Tumults and Unquietneſs, but of Peace in all the Churches of the Saints; therefore then confuſed, tumultuous, unquiet, undeſent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Spirits, with the Power and Spirit of God they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to the peaceable Spirit of God in them, and with it judge out the contrary, elſe the Church of Chriſt, in its power and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit can have no unity with them, but with the ſpirit and power of Chriſt, judge that undeſent, confuſed, tumultuous, unquiet, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Spirit; for God, (as I ſaid before) is a God of Order, but the Devil, which is the Worlds God, hath made the World like a Wilderneſs, which lies in Wickedneſs; and this Devil or Satan, in whom there is no Truth, the power of death, and darkneſs, and confuſion, got into <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by their diſobedience, and rules in the hearts of the Diſobedient, where all tumults, diſquietneſs, confuſion and diſorders are; for who went and go into diſobedience from God, they went and are gone from his Image, from the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſimplicity, and his power and ſpirit within, and ſo go out, and from his Power, Spirit and Image (in which his holy Order is) and go out of ſimplicity and innocency, into ſubtilty and craft; for the Devil, that abode not in the Truth, and his followers, that diſobey God and his Truth, which follow the Devil, in whom there is no Truth, there is no order, but confuſion. Truth hath an order for all things that God did make by Jeſus Chriſt, upholds all things by his Word and Power: So with his Word and Power
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:207491:14"/>he keeps all things in their places, and in their order, in their times, and in their ſeaſons, the Summer and the Winter, the Night and the Day, the Sun, Moon and the Stars, all things are kept in order by the <hi>Word of God</hi> and his <hi>Power,</hi> and the Earth is the Lords, and the fullneſs thereof, and the Sea, and the fullneſs therein. So both the Earth and the Sea, and all things therein are kept in their order by the Word and Power of God, by which they were made, by which they are upheld: So all the works of the Lord praiſe him, and all men and women that are in the Truth, which makes them free from him that abode not in the Truth, in whom there is no Truth: So all Gods free People or Children, that are made free indeed by the Truth, are in the order of the Truth, and in the order of the Spirit of God, and in the order of the Goſpel, and are in the order of the Light, the Life in Chriſt, and are over the foul Spirit of Diſorder, in the Land of Death and Darkneſs; as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>A Land of Darkneſs, as Darkneſs it ſelf, and of the ſhadow of Death, without any Order, [Mark]</hi> without any Order, where the Light is as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This Spirit may cry out againſt Orders, whoſe Habitation is Darkneſs, without any order; but as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Who offers up Praiſe, glorifies me, and he that orders his Converſation aright, ſhall ſee the Salvation of God.</hi> Now here is a particular Order for every man and woman to obſerve; for the ſteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, <hi>and he delight in his way,</hi> Pſal. 37. The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt forever after the order of Melchizedeck,</hi> Pſal. 110. Heb. 5. and Chriſt is not called after the order of <hi>Aaron, Heb.</hi> 7. Here you may ſee, <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> the Prieſt was not made without an Order, and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſthood was made by an order of God, according to his Rod's budding in the Tabernacle; and Chriſt was not a Prieſt made without an Order, which is after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> and his Royal Prieſthood, which offers up ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God, are in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Order, and in the Order of the ſpirit of God. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, chap. 9. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulders.</hi> So here, Chriſt bears up his Government, <hi>and of the increaſe of his Government and Peace, there ſhall be no end;</hi> for Chriſt orders it and eſtabliſhes it, &amp;c. So Chriſt's Government is a peaceable Government, and there is no ſtrife in it; and Chriſt's Government is peaceable in his Power, Light and Spirit. And the Apoſtle, after he had exhorted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of many things, ſaid, <hi>The reſt I will ſet in order when I come;</hi> and this was by the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:207491:15"/>Power and Spirit of Chriſt. And the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now here you may ſee the Apoſtle was for <hi>good Order,</hi> and eſtabliſhed good Order in the Church of Chriſt, and encouraged <hi>Titus</hi> to ſet in order, and ordain Elders in every City in <hi>Creet,</hi> which were wanting, ſo that all the Church of Chriſt might be kept in the Order and Power and Spirit of Chriſt. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Coloſians, Though I be abſent in the fleſh, yet I am with you in the ſpirit, joying and beholding your Order, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of your Faith in Chriſt; and as you therefore have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him.</hi> Now here you may ſee, the Church of Chriſt had a ſpiritual order, though the Apoſtle was abſent in the fleſh from them, yet he was preſent with them in his ſpirit, with which ſpirit he rejoyced, and beheld their ſpiritual order; ſo in this ſpiritual order muſt all Gods People live, though they be abſent in Body one from another, yet in the ſpirit they may rejoyce, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpiritual order that is in the Church of Chriſt, and the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of one anothers Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Author and Finiſher of it.</p>
